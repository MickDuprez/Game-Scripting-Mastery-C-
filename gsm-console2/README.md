## Game Scripting Mastery in Rust - Basic Command Scripting 2 ##
This project creates a basic game engine with Piston to which I will add basic command style scripting capabilities as per the second part of Command Scripting of the book.
Instead of a sprite I will use a triangle to illustrate direction when moving the object via the script.
