# Game Scripting Mastery in C#
## Command Scripting Example
I have tried to stick with the format of the book where possible and there are a myriad of ways 
to do this given the extensive libraries available in the .Net framework.


For Example, regex could have been used and I could have done away with the helper commands
and processed the script line in the switch routine.


I had thoughts of 'future proofing' the code and it was a good exercise in sticking to the spec's :)
