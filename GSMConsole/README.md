## Game Scriting Mastery - Basic Command Scripting in C# ##

This was the first project in the book which I decided to do in C# to get a feel for the book as I'm doing the exercises as I go.

The next part of the book requires a simple game to script. This is available on the book's CD but I've been wanting to do some
Rust OpenGL coding for a while and this is a good oportunity to set up a basic OpenGL project and start scripting.
